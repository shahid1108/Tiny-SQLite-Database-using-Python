# Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python [Python + SQLite3]

- This project demonstrates how to interact with a SQLite3 database using Python. The notebook covers key operations such as creating tables, inserting records, querying data, and performing basic data analysis. It serves as a practical example of integrating SQL with Python using the built-in sqlite3 module.
